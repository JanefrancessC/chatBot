Project Description: SMS Messaging System

Overview:

The primary goal is to automate the process of initiating communication with individuals by sending personalized messages based on the information provided in the CSV file.

Features:

CSV Data Parsing: The system reads contact information from a CSV file, extracting relevant details such as name, cellphone number, and country.
